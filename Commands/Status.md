# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful whern it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of you repository.

Using `git status` will show you changes are beiong tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc.

Status is a command that is safe to use at any time.
If you want to see what is going on it's good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know the flow better.

```
get add .
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push
git status
```
